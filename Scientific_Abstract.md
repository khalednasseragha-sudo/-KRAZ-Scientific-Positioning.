## Scientific Abstract

The KRAZ Abstract Computational Engine is a formally specified framework designed to
analyze signal convergence behavior under controlled abstract constraints.
Through a series of validated simulations, the model demonstrates structural invariance,
deterministic stability under fixed statistical envelopes, causal coherence, and
counterfactual consistency.

All results are derived from abstract signal processing without reference to biological,
clinical, or cognitive systems. This record represents a frozen scientific artifact
intended for academic analysis and methodological discussion.
