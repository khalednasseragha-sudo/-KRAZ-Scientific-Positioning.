## Overview
This repository constitutes the formal scientific record of the KRAZ Abstract Computational Engine.
KRAZ is a purely abstract computational framework designed to study high-precision signal convergence,
stability, and invariance under controlled mathematical constraints.

The project operates strictly within the domain of Abstract Signal Processing (ASP) and is explicitly
decoupled from biological, neurological, or clinical interpretations.

## Purpose of This Record
This deposition is intended to:
- Establish historical and scientific priority
- Preserve a frozen, auditable version of the model
- Enable academic review and discussion

No executable system or production code is claimed.

## Contents
- Formal specifications
- Validated simulation results
- Traceability documentation
- Scientific integrity statements

## Scope Limitation
KRAZ does not claim consciousness, cognition, intelligence, or physical embodiment.
All findings are valid exclusively within the defined abstract computational model.

## Citation
Please cite this record using the DOI assigned by Zenodo.
