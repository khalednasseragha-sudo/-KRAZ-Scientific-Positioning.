# Scientific Positioning

### 📜 Abstract
KRAZ introduces the concept of **"Adaptive Zero-Point Integrity"**. It is a mathematical positioning system that allows technical structures to maintain stability ($S$) by aligning internal mass ($M$) with integrity thresholds ($\epsilon$), effectively eliminating the noise that leads to systemic conflict or dependency.

### 🌍 Global Impact
- **Humanity:** Focused on living in peace and freedom.
- **Independence:** Moving away from wars and centralized technological dependency.
- **Resilience:** Forged with an unyielding will to serve as a technical beacon.

### 🏛️ Historical Context
**"From Aleppo, the oldest continually inhabited city in history, to the world."**
